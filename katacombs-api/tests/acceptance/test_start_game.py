    """ACCEPTANCE TEST: Full Business Flow - "As a player, I want to start a new game so that I can begin playing Katacombs"

    This test covers the complete business flow:
    1. Player creates a new game (POST /game/player)
    2. System creates player and places them in starting location
    3. Player can view their current location (GET /player/{playerSid}/location)
    4. Player can see location description, exits, and available items
    5. Player can view their empty bag (GET /player/{playerSid}/bag)

    This is a REAL acceptance test covering multiple API calls and the complete user journey.
