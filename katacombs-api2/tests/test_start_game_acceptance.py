Acceptance test for Story 1: Start Game with Player Creation

This test sketches the complete use case flow to identify needed ports and behavior.
Following Pedro's Algorithm (Outside-In TDD), we start here and work inward.

Test will initially fail to compile until we define the required ports.

        ACCEPTANCE TEST SKETCH - Story 1

        Given I provide a valid player name and unique SID
        When I start a new game via POST /game/player
        Then:
        - A new player is created with the provided name and SID
        - The player is placed at the starting location (Truman Brewery)
        - I receive a 201 Created response with player details
        - The response includes: sid, name, location description, bag (empty), available exits

        PORTS NEEDED (identified from this test):
        - PlayerRepository: save(player), find_by_sid(sid)
        - WorldRepository: get_world() -> World with starting location
        - TimeProviderPort: now() -> datetime for events

        BEHAVIOR NEEDED:
        - StartGameCommandHandler orchestrates the flow
        - Player aggregate creation and validation
        - World aggregate provides starting location
        - Proper error handling and validation

# Next steps after this sketch:
# 1. Define PlayerRepository interface (so we can create fake_player_repo)
# 2. Define WorldRepository interface (so we can create fake_world_repo)
# 3. Define TimeProviderPort interface (so we can create mock_time_provider)
# 4. Complete the acceptance tests with actual assertions
# 5. Watch tests fail (RED)
# 6. Implement StartGameCommandHandler (GREEN)
# 7. Implement domain objects as needed by the handler
