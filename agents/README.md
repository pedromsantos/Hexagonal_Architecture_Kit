# Agent Catalog

This directory contains specialized agents for implementing features following Pedro's Algorithm with hexagonal architecture and DDD patterns.

## üéØ Getting Started

**Start here**: [orchestrator.md](orchestrator.md) - Coordinates all agents and determines workflow entry points.

## üîÑ Typical Agent Flow

### For New Features

1. **Planning**: `writers/planning/user_story` ‚Üí `reviewers/user_story` ‚Üí `writers/planning/story_slicer` ‚Üí `writers/planning/architect`
2. **TDD Cycle**: `writers/tests/acceptance` ‚Üí (`writers/tests/unit` ‚Üí domain/application implementers)\* ‚Üí `writers/tests/integration` ‚Üí `writers/tests/contract`
3. **Review**: All reviewer agents validate before final commit

### Entry Points by Situation

- **No stories**: Start with `writers/planning/user_story`
- **Have stories**: Start with `reviewers/user_story`
- **Ready stories**: Start with `writers/planning/architect`
- **Have architecture**: Start with `writers/tests/acceptance`

## üìñ Usage Guidelines

### Agent Coordination

- **Always use orchestrator** to coordinate agent sequence
- **Follow Pedro's Algorithm** as defined in orchestrator
- **Maintain proper boundaries** between agent responsibilities

### Quality Gates

- **User stories must pass review** (85%+ quality score) before implementation
- **All tests must be GREEN** before commits
- **All review agents must pass** before final commit

### Common Patterns

- **One repository per aggregate** - Use repository_interface_designer + repository_implementer
- **CQRS separation** - Use command_handler_implementer OR query_handler_implementer
- **Test taxonomy** - Different test types have specific agents and boundaries
- **Mock discipline** - Only mock adapters, never domain objects

## üéØ Success Indicators

- ‚úÖ Acceptance test stays RED until complete feature implemented
- ‚úÖ Each agent produces working, tested output
- ‚úÖ Clean commits on each green cycle
- ‚úÖ All review agents pass quality gates
- ‚úÖ Real business value delivered

**Remember**: The orchestrator coordinates everything. Individual agents focus on their specific expertise while the orchestrator ensures proper sequencing and quality gates.
